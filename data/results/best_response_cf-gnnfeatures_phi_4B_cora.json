However, when we examine the counterfactual situation where Node 1 retains connections with Node 0 but alters some of its features\u2014changing 'memori' to 'environ,' 'oper' to 'complex,' 'markov' to 'wide,' and introducing new features such as 'result,' 'educational,' and 'multimodal'\u2014the classification shifts to 'Case_Based'. This suggests that the inclusion of practical, real-world examples ('result,' 'educational') and broader methodologies ('multimodal') associated with applying theories to cases significantly influenced the reclassification. Although both nodes remain connected, reflecting potential thematic overlap, the shift in Node 1's features implies a transition towards more empirical approaches rather than purely theoretical ones. Thus, the neighboring Node 0, while still sharing a connection, does not directly contribute to the change in classification; instead, it highlights the importance of individual node characteristics in determining the overall classification within the context of the Cora dataset.Original target nodes features: ['memori', 'oper', 'markov', 'switch', 'maintain', 'interview', 'planner', 'correlate', 'inherit', 'relationship', 'systematic', 'resolve', 'convert', 'rollback', 'chapter', 'bulk', 'lesson']",

However, when we examine the counterfactual situation where Node 0 retains some of these features but gains others indicative of theoretical study ('principle'), the classification shifts to 'Theory'. This suggests that incorporating more conceptually oriented terms alters our understanding of the node's role within the context of the graph. Specifically, the addition of 'principle' implies a shift towards fundamental theories rather than practical implementations. Furthermore, while the neighbors remain consistent across both scenarios, indicating stable connections within the graph, the change in Node 0's features directly impacts its classification. This demonstrates the sensitivity of graph-based models to local feature variations and underscores the importance of considering both global topology and local attribute distributions when interpreting results.Original target nodes features: ['function', 'oper', 'improv', 'runtime', 'small', 'layout', 'explan', 'result', 'backpropagate', 'demand', 'steer', 'brain', 'scan', 'perceptron', 'gateway', 'np', 'lexicon', 'confidence', 'apprentice', 'mutate', 'electric', 'repositories']",

However, when we modify the feature set of Node 1 by replacing 'fourier' with 'band', the nature of the connection shifts towards theoretical exploration, hence reclassifying Node 1 as belonging to the 'Theory' category. This suggests that the inclusion of the term 'band' may imply a more conceptual or fundamental study rather than a pragmatic approach. Additionally, since Node 0 remains unchanged in both cases, it implies that the neighboring relationship alone does not account for the shift in classification; rather, it is the modification of Node 1's features that drives the change. In essence, the transition from 'Rule_Learning' to 'Theory' reflects a move away from empirical methodologies toward a more abstract inquiry.Original target nodes features: ['environ', 'manag', 'user', 'practic', 'issu', 'aggreg', 'fair', 'multiag', 'revers', 'wrapper', 'nonsymmetr', 'need', 'gateway', 'ru', 'np', 'place', 'skill', 'imper', 'fourier', 'ed', 'subdivis', 'lesson']",

These features align more closely with techniques associated with case-based reasoning rather than those typically found in genetic algorithms. However, when we hypothesize a counterfactual situation where Node 2's features include 'genetic_algorithm' instead of 'case_based,' the classification shifts to 'Genetic_Algorithms.' This suggests that the inclusion of terms indicative of genetic algorithms significantly alters our understanding of the node's content. Influences from neighboring nodes remain consistent across both scenarios since they do not contribute directly to the change in classification; however, the broader context provided by these connections may reinforce the relevance of the changed features within the field of study.Original target nodes features: ['method', 'via', 'c', 'common', 'programm', 'merg', 'gateway', 'tensor']",

These features suggest a focus on logical inference and pattern recognition within the context of rule-based systems. However, when considering a counterfactual situation where these features are replaced with those present in Node 0\u2014such as 'toward,' 'forward,' 'site,' 'confid,' 'resili,' and 'princip'\u2014the nature of the node's characteristics shifts towards a more general set of attributes that do not explicitly indicate rule-learning methodologies. Despite this shift in individual features, both the factual and counterfactual scenarios still fall under the same classification category, 'Rule_Learning,' because the core domain remains consistent across both cases. The influence of neighboring nodes does not directly affect the classification here since the primary determining factor is the inherent features associated with Node 2 itself. Nonetheless, understanding the broader context provided by neighboring nodes could offer additional insights into why certain features align with the 'Rule_Learning' classification.Original target nodes features: ['fault', 'thread', 'mach', 'walk', 'dissemin', 'confid', 'princip']",

These features suggest a focus on probabilistic approaches within the context of scientific publications. However, when we consider a counterfactual scenario where only the features 'cut' and 'np' are present, there is no direct indication that these features alone would align with the 'Probabilistic_Methods' category. Instead, they seem more generic and less specialized towards probabilistic methodologies. Despite this, since both the factual and counterfactual examples share the same neighbor nodes ('0' and '15') and retain the same overall classification ('Probabilistic_Methods'), the influence of neighboring nodes does not significantly alter the classification of node 17. In essence, while changing the features of node 17 to 'cut' and 'np' shifts away from the explicit thematic markers associated with 'Probabilistic_Methods,' the shared connections with other nodes in the graph may still support a similar classification due to the interconnected nature of the dataset. This highlights the importance of considering both local feature characteristics and broader structural patterns when interpreting classifications in graph-based learning tasks.Original target nodes features: ['action, workstat, verifi, illumin, treatment, credit']",
    "66": "In the original scenario, Node 1, representing a scientific publication, was classified under 'Neural_Networks' based on its features - 'best' and 'highway'. These features likely relate to aspects of neural network performance or architecture within the context of the Cora dataset. However, when we create a counterfactual situation where Node 1 retains connections to Node 4 but alters its own features to ['forward', 'testb', 'kerbero', 'np'], it shifts the classification to 'Probabilistic_Methods'. This suggests that these new features ('forward', 'testb', 'kerbero', 'np') are more indicative of probabilistic approaches rather than neural network methodologies. For instance, 'forward' may imply progression towards understanding probability distributions, while 'testb' and 'kerbero' could hint at testing belief systems or Bayesian inference techniques commonly associated with probabilistic models. Additionally, 'np' might suggest the use of NumPy, a library often employed in statistical computations relevant to probabilistic methods. The influence of neighboring nodes remains consistent since they maintain connectivity; however, the shift in classification underscores the importance of individual node features over mere structural similarity. In essence, even though Node 1 shares a connection with Node 4, the fundamental nature of its information content\u2014as reflected through its modified set of features\u2014dictates its reclassification into a category aligned with probabilistic theories.Original target nodes features: ['best', 'highway']",

These features suggest a focus on probability distributions and statistical analysis commonly associated with probabilistic methods. However, when we introduce a counterfactual scenario where the features of Node 0 are changed to include 'power' instead of 'logarithm,' the classification shifts to 'Reinforcement_Learning.' This change implies that the inclusion of 'power'\u2014a term often associated with energy, strength, and computational capacity\u2014aligns more closely with reinforcement learning principles. In reinforcement learning, agents learn to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties ('power') for actions taken within an environment. Therefore, the modification of Node 0's features to incorporate 'power' suggests a shift towards a context where decision-making processes driven by reward mechanisms become relevant, indicating a transition from probabilistic methodologies to those centered around learning policies through trial and error.Original target nodes features: ['agent', 'multipl', 'feedback', 'multilevel', 'logarithm', 'unreli', 'popul']",

These changes suggest that adjustments in key features influence the classification of Node 3. Specifically, the introduction of terms like 'planar', 'good', and 'interior' along with maintaining connectivity with Nodes 0 and 1 align more closely with the themes typically discussed in reinforcement learning literature. Thus, even though Node 3 remains connected to similar types of nodes, the subtle yet significant shift in its own feature set leads to a reclassification within the domain of reinforcement learning. This demonstrates the sensitivity of graph-based models to local structural and attribute changes, highlighting the importance of understanding both direct and indirect effects of these changes on the global behavior of the system.Original target nodes features: ['traffic', 'decomposit', 'equat', 'symbol', 'common', 'solver', 'interpol', 'commit', 'interoper', 'lock', 'backpropag', 'initi', 'edg', 'close', 'pack', 'gateway', 'singular', 'mutat']",

This suggests that the inclusion of these particular features aligns more closely with case-based approaches rather than purely theoretical ones. The influence of neighboring nodes remains consistent across both scenarios since they share the same connections; however, the key factor driving the shift in classification lies within the modification of Node 0's own features. By changing the nature of the features from being indicative of theoretical work to those suggesting a focus on cases and practical examples, the underlying assumption made by the model regarding Node 0's category alters significantly.Original target nodes features: ['adapt', 'hybrid', 'surfac', 'recoveri', 'qualit', 'interv', 'quantiz', 'explan', 'debug', 'expert', 'result', 'basic', 'tractabl', 'mit', 'kalman', 'gateway', 'permut', 'confid', 'uniqu', 'polari']",

However, when we examine the counterfactual situation where Node 9 retains its connections but its features are altered to match those typical of 'Case_Based' literature, we observe several key changes. Specifically, the terms associated with more theoretical aspects like 'equat,' 'collect,' 'solver,' and 'review' are replaced with more practical, domain-specific terms such as 'applic,' 'choic,' 'node,' and 'testb.' These adjustments suggest a shift towards a focus on concrete examples and methodologies rather than abstract theories. Despite these changes, since both the factual and counterfactual scenarios result in the same classification ('Case_Based'), it implies that the neighboring nodes (0 and 4) still support a context consistent with case-based approaches. Therefore, while individual features were modified to reflect a closer alignment with 'Case_Based' terminology, the overall influence of neighboring nodes remains unchanged, reinforcing the initial classification.Original target nodes features: ['implement', 'represent', 'equat', 'collect', 'reduc', 'solver', 'review', 'invers', 'achiev', 'cross', 'newton', 'place', 'confid']",

These changes indicate that even though Node 2 maintains connections with Node 1, the modification of its feature set leads to a reclassification of the node within the context of neural network literature. This demonstrates the importance of both local connectivity and global feature composition in determining the classification of nodes in graph-based learning tasks.Original target nodes features: ['schedul', 'queue', 'common', 'audio', 'spoken', 'initi', 'achiev', 'gateway', 'rollback', 'electr']",

This suggests that the inclusion of these particular features strongly associates Node 4 with the characteristics typical of Probabilistic_Methods rather than Reinforcement_Learning. The influence of neighboring nodes remains consistent across both scenarios, indicating that while the features play a crucial role in determining the classification, the structural connectivity within the graph does not contribute significantly to the difference in classification between the factual and counterfactual cases.Original target nodes features: ['verif', 'shape', 'fit', 'precondit', 'dbm', 'crash', 'environment']",

This suggests that the inclusion of these new features significantly alters the perception of Node 7's role within the domain of study. Influences from neighboring nodes may contribute to this shift; for instance, connections with Nodes representing other areas like Processes (Node 1) and Atmospheric Conditions (Node 4) suggest interdisciplinary relevance. Furthermore, the proximity to Class-Based learning (Nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11) implies potential cross-influence, reinforcing the notion that even subtle changes in node characteristics can result in substantial reclassification.Original target nodes features: ['simpl', 'array', 'squar', 'confid', 'financi', 'polari']",

These features suggest a focus on structural patterns and recursive definitions commonly associated with rule-based systems. However, when considering a counterfactual situation where only the 'behaviour' feature is changed while keeping other neighboring nodes constant ('0' and '14'), there isn't a direct implication that the classification would shift away from Rule Learning. In Rule Learning, behavioral aspects may influence the formation of rules but do not necessarily dictate the primary classification methodology. Since both the factual and counterfactual examples maintain the same classification as Rule Learning, we infer that changing the 'behaviour' feature alone does not significantly impact the overall classification of Node 9. Instead, the classification seems robust against minor variations in individual node features, indicating that the core characteristics defining Rule Learning\u2014such as the use of logical rules and inference mechanisms\u2014are preserved despite these adjustments.Original target nodes features: ['graph', 'recurs', 'lexic']",

These adjustments imply that even though Node 0 maintains its connection with Node 1, the nature of its scholarly focus has transformed dramatically. In essence, the counterfactual analysis reveals that minor yet strategic alterations in the node's feature representation\u2014mirroring the thematic elements typical of reinforcement learning literature\u2014can result in a reclassification of the node within the domain of study. Such insight underscores the sensitivity of GNNs to local structural and semantic variations, highlighting the importance of understanding both individual node characteristics and their interconnectedness within the broader graph topology.Original target nodes features: ['oper', 'servic', 'hybrid', 'synthesi', 'discret', 'updat', 'bandwidth', 'common', 'reflect', 'audio', 'ieee', 'famili', 'commerci', 'best', 'logp', 'gateway', 'np', 'rfc', 'confid', 'pivot', 'ing', 'chapter']",

However, when considering the counterfactual situation where Node 1 retains the same neighbors but is reclassified as belonging to Reinforcement_Learning, we observe no direct changes in the node's features themselves; they remain consistent across both scenarios. Instead, the shift in classification reflects a reinterpretation of the node's role within the context of its connections to other nodes. Specifically, despite maintaining similar feature sets, the reinforcement learning framework emphasizes learning policies for action selection in environments shaped by states and actions\u2014a concept potentially inferred from the interactions ('relationship') and methodologies ('mit' suggesting modification techniques) associated with the node's neighbors. In essence, while the node's intrinsic characteristics do not differ between the factual and counterfactual cases, the broader interpretation of these traits within the relational dynamics of the graph leads to a different understanding of the node's function and contribution to the overall task at hand.Original target nodes features: ['collect', 'relationship', 'mit', 'spin', 'gateway']",

These features align with typical characteristics associated with computational approaches and problem-solving strategies inherent to Genetic_Algorithms. On the other hand, the counterfactual scenario presents features such as 'audio, transpar, massiv, disjunct, confid, oracl, electr, claus.' While these features may seem unrelated to traditional Genetic_Algorithms, they indicate a shift towards more abstract or conceptual elements ('audio, transpar, oracl') and possibly electronic components ('electr'). Despite these changes, the classification does not differ because the core thematic association with Genetic_Algorithms persists. The influence of neighboring nodes (nodes 0 and 1) remains consistent across both scenarios, suggesting that the local graph structure around the target node plays a crucial role in maintaining the same classification despite variations in individual node features.Original target nodes features: ['adapt, mechan, hardwar, workstat, packet, human, basi, reflect, audio, lock, best, obstacl, discontinu, testb, pack, abduct, predictor, short, singular, thing, confid, overlap, rollback, introduc, ubiquit']",

However, when considering a counterfactual situation where Node 6 possesses 'multipl', 'resourc', 'lock', 'equal', and 'place' as additional features while retaining some of its original ones ('multipl'), there may be subtle shifts in the influence exerted by its neighbors. Despite these changes, the overall classification remains Rule_Learning because the core characteristics aligning Node 6 with Rule Learning principles persist. Nonetheless, the introduction of new features suggests potential nuances in the interpretation of its role within the broader domain of Rule Learning, possibly indicating alternative perspectives or methodologies reflected among its peer nodes.Original target nodes features: ['decis', 'java', 'nonlinear', 'volum', 'singl', 'media', 'investig', 'critiqu', 'thing', 'trend']",

This suggests that while the intrinsic properties of Node 3 remain consistent, the context provided by its neighboring nodes\u2014specifically Nodes 1 and 2\u2014plays a crucial role in determining its classification. In the counterfactual instance, despite retaining similar characteristics, the influence of adjacent nodes leads to a reclassification. This implies that the local neighborhood structure within the graph significantly impacts the interpretation of Node 3's function or category. By changing only the labels without modifying the actual features or connections, we observe how sensitive the classification system is to the broader graph topology and the potential interactions among nodes.Original target nodes features: ['reflect', 'choic', 'warp', 'pack', 'almost', 'adversari']",

However, when we examine the counterfactual situation where Node 3's features include 'adapt,' 'multiply,' 'channel,' 'IEEE,' 'backpropagate,' 'testbed,' and 'capable,' there is a shift towards characteristics associated with Reinforcement Learning. Here, 'adapt' implies flexibility and learning from interactions, 'multiply' may relate to scaling solutions, 'channel' suggests communication pathways often explored in reinforcement contexts, 'IEEE' hints at standardization relevant to systematic approaches, 'backpropagate' aligns with error correction mechanisms common in learning algorithms, 'testbed' denotes experimental settings conducive to iterative improvement, and 'capable' reflects potential for sophisticated decision-making processes. The transformation of these features from those indicative of rule-based methodologies to ones resonating with the principles of Reinforcement Learning illustrates how subtle shifts in node attributes can influence classification outcomes.

These changes indicate that the inclusion of these particular features may influence the model to associate Node 4 with methodologies involving agent interaction, environment exploration, and reward-based learning mechanisms typical of reinforcement learning paradigms. Additionally, since Node 4 remains connected to Node 3, which itself is associated with both 'Reinforcement_Learning' and 'Probabilistic_Methods', there is likely an underlying thematic linkage or shared context within the graph that supports this reclassification.

These features likely indicate a shift towards computational approaches involving optimization problems, possibly reflective of the underlying themes present in neighboring nodes 1, 2, and 3, which themselves are associated with Genetic Algorithms. Thus, the influence of the neighboring nodes seems to reinforce the transition in classification, highlighting the interconnected nature of the graph and the importance of both local and global context in determining the classification of a node.Original target nodes features: ['oper', 'cluster', 'transport', 'vision', 'situat', 'common', 'sprite']",

This shift suggests that the inclusion of these particular features\u2014which may relate more closely to pattern recognition, prediction capabilities, and adaptive learning processes typical of neural network approaches\u2014plays a significant role in reclassification. Furthermore, since Node 6 shares connections with Nodes 0, 1, and 9 in both scenarios, the influence of neighboring nodes remains consistent. Their shared connectivity implies that while the local feature set around Node 6 changed, leading to a different classification, the broader context provided by its neighbors did not contribute to this transition.

These changes suggest that the underlying patterns captured by the node's features shift towards methodologies commonly utilized within the domain of probabilistic models rather than those characteristic of reinforcement learning paradigms. Despite these substantial alterations in feature space, both the factual and counterfactual examples maintain the same classification label 'Reinforcement_Learning'. This implies that while the individual features may differ, they still collectively support the notion that the node represents a concept or entity involved in reinforcement learning processes. Moreover, since the neighboring nodes remain unchanged, there is no direct influence observed from them regarding the switch in classification.

However, when we examine the counterfactual situation where Node 5 retains only the features 'formal,' 'procedur,' 'earli,' 'length,' 'multiprocess,' 'resili,' and 'bulk,' these characteristics align more closely with theoretical constructs rather than practical rule-learning approaches. Specifically, the removal of domain-specific terms ('network,' 'object,' 'verif,' etc.) suggests a shift towards a broader, less application-focused perspective, characteristic of theoretical exploration. Furthermore, the persistence of 'formal' and 'procedur' hints at a systematic approach but without direct reference to empirical problem-solving strategies.

This reclassification suggests that while Node 8 maintains its connectivity pattern within the domain of computational approaches, the nature of its features aligns more closely with the principles underlying neural network methodologies. Specifically, the inclusion of 'simpl' hints at straightforward processing units characteristic of neurons, 'autom' implies automaticity reminiscent of self-optimizing systems, and 'tutor' may suggest supervised learning paradigms.

    "177": "In the original scenario, Node 1 was classified under 'Probabilistic_Methods' based on its features like 'control', 'solver', 'unif', 'ada', 'constant', and 'rollback'. However, when we create a counterfactual situation where the features of Node 1 are slightly modified\u2014specifically changing 'rollback' to 'mutat' and introducing 'princip'\u2014the classification shifts to 'Reinforcement_Learning'. This suggests that these particular feature changes significantly influence the prediction made by the model. Since Node 1 shares connections with Node 3 in both scenarios, it implies that the neighboring nodes may contribute contextually relevant information that supports the shift in classification. In reinforcement learning, aspects like 'mutat' and 'princip' could relate to adaptive strategies and principles guiding agent behavior, respectively, aligning more closely with the characteristics of papers within the 'Reinforcement_Learning' category.Original target nodes features: ['control', 'solver', 'unif', 'ada', 'constant', 'rollback']",
    "191": "In the original scenario, the target node 1 was classified under 'Probabilistic_Methods' based on its features - 'cluster', 'access', 'solver', 'admiss', and 'pack'. However, when we examine the counterfactual situation, these features remain unchanged except for the removal of 'admiss' and 'pack'. By removing these two features ('admiss' and 'pack'), the classification shifts to 'Reinforcement_Learning'. This suggests that the inclusion of 'admiss' and 'pack' in the feature set strongly associates the node with 'Probabilistic_Methods'. In contrast, their absence aligns the node more closely with 'Reinforcement_Learning'. The influence of neighboring nodes remains consistent across both scenarios since they do not contribute any additional information regarding the classification shift. Therefore, the primary factor driving the change in classification lies within the node's own feature set rather than external factors like connections with other nodes.Original target nodes features: ['cluster', 'access', 'solver', 'admiss', 'pack']",
    "195": "In the original graph, Node 8 was classified under Rule_Learning with features indicating terms like 'lexic,' 'quantiz,' 'privat,' etc., associated with it through connections to Nodes 2, 9, and 10. However, when we examine the counterfactual scenario where Node 8 retains its connections but exhibits a shift in its feature set\u2014changing 'lexic' to 'autom,' 'quantiz' to 'rate,' and so forth\u2014the nature of these features suggests a transition towards characteristics more aligned with Rule_Learning. Specifically, the inclusion of 'autom,' 'rate,' 'investig,' 'pack,' 'overlap,' 'uniq,' 'sprite,' and 'princi' hints at a focus on procedural aspects and logical constructs typical of rule-based systems. These adjustments imply that even though the immediate neighborhood remains constant, the semantic orientation of Node 8 shifts closer to the domain of rule extraction and inference. Consequently, despite maintaining similar connectivity patterns, the nuanced transformation in feature representation leads to a consistent classification within the same category, underscoring the importance of both local topology and global feature distribution in determining node classification outcomes.Original target nodes features: ['lexic', 'quantiz', 'privat', 'quorum', 'thing', 'mutat', 'crossov']",
    "198": "In the original graph, Node 0 was associated with features indicative of 'Probabilistic_Methods,' likely reflecting its content relating to probabilistic models and techniques. However, when we examine the counterfactual scenario where Node 0 retains connections to Node 1 but alters several key features\u2014specifically removing terms like 'complex,' 'code,' 'rout,' 'packet,' 'rigid,' 'restrict,' and 'gap'\u2014the predicted class shifts to 'Reinforcement_Learning.' This suggests that these removed features were critical in determining the initial classification under 'Probabilistic_Methods.' By changing them, the context implied by Node 0's features aligns more closely with the characteristics typically associated with reinforcement learning literature, such as decision processes ('next'), theoretical aspects ('defin'), and practical applications ('internetwork'). The influence of neighboring nodes remains consistent across both scenarios, indicating that while the local feature adjustments significantly impact the classification, the overall structural connectivity within the graph plays a stabilizing role in maintaining the relationship between Nodes 0 and 1.Original target nodes features: ['complex', 'code', 'rout', 'packet', 'fair', 'throughput', 'next', 'defin', 'edit', 'rigid', 'restrict', 'hpf', 'internetwork', 'alias', 'np', 'gap', 'student', 'usag', 'lesson']",
    "199": "In the original graph representing the Cora dataset, Node 14 was classified under the category 'Probabilistic_Methods'. However, when we examine the counterfactual scenario where Node 14 retains connections with Nodes 13, 5, 8, and 12 but alters some of its features, the classification remains 'Probabilistic_Methods'. This suggests that despite changing several features associated with probability and inference (e.g., replacing 'reason' with 'control', 'fuzzi' with 'multiprocessor'), these adjustments do not significantly impact the overall thematic alignment of the node within the context of the dataset. In essence, while individual features may shift towards characteristics more commonly associated with other categories like 'Neural_Networks' or 'Reinforcement_Learning', they still fall within the broader scope of 'Probabilistic_Methods'. The influence of neighboring nodes\u2014which remain consistent across both scenarios\u2014further supports this interpretation, indicating that the local neighborhood plays a role in maintaining the node's classification even after modifying its feature set.Original target nodes features: ['reason', 'fuzzi', 'conceptu', 'fusion', 'gateway']",
    "200": "In the original graph representing the Cora dataset, node 14 was classified under the category 'Reinforcement_Learning'. However, when we examine the counterfactual scenario where the features of node 14 are changed to match those of node 0, the classification shifts to 'Case_Based'. This suggests that the inclusion of keywords like 'experi', 'replic', 'router', 'mach', 'microkernel', 'gateway', and 'reachabl' associated with node 0 align more closely with the themes typically discussed in 'Case_Based' literature rather than 'Reinforcement_Learning'. These terms suggest a focus on practical examples and experiences ('experi', 'replic') and hardware components ('router', 'mach', 'microkernel', 'gateway'), which may indicate a shift towards methodologies grounded in empirical cases and established practices within the domain of case-based reasoning. Additionally, the consistent connectivity pattern among neighboring nodes remains unchanged, implying that the local neighborhood context around node 14 does not significantly influence this transition in classification. Instead, the fundamental difference lies in the semantic alignment of the modified feature set with the conceptual framework of 'Case_Based' approaches.Original target nodes features: ['via', 'presenc', 'spline', 'residu', 'back', 'polari']",
    "209": "In the original scenario, Node 2 was classified under Rule Learning based on its features, which included terms like 'oper,' 'equat,' 'surfac,' 'thread,' 'solver,' 'spoken,' 'good,' 'divers,' and 'confid.' These features suggest a focus on computational processes, problem-solving techniques, and possibly software development methodologies associated with rule-based systems. However, when we examine the counterfactual situation where Node 2 retains some but not all of these features\u2014specifically changing 'oper,' 'equat,' 'surfac,' 'thread,' 'solver,' 'spoken,' 'good,' and 'divers'\u2014the remaining features ('technic,' 'critic,' 'expert,' 'relev,' 'result,' 'confid,' 'chapter,' and 'tutor') shift the context towards theoretical aspects. Here, 'technic' may still imply technical depth, while 'critic' suggests analytical thinking; however, 'expert' leans more toward academic proficiency rather than practical computation. 'Relev' and 'result' hint at significance and outcomes, potentially within a scholarly framework. 'Confid' remains consistent, indicating reliance on confidence or trustworthiness. Lastly, 'chapter' and 'tutor' strongly indicate educational material or instructional guidance, which are typically aligned with theoretical exploration and teaching. Therefore, the modification of several key features leads to a reclassification of Node 2 from Rule Learning to Theory, reflecting a transition from practical, computational approaches to those grounded in conceptual understanding and pedagogy.Original target nodes features: ['oper, equat, surfac, technic, thread, solver, spoken, good, divers, confid']",
    "212": "In both the factual and counterfactual examples, the target node (node 1) remains classified under 'Probabilistic_Methods'. However, there are significant changes in the node's features when comparing the factual scenario to the counterfactual one. In the factual scenario, the node features include terms like 'model', 'object', 'autom', 'strategi', 'appear', 'nest', 'precondit', and 'gateway', which align closely with themes typically associated with 'Neural_Networks'. Conversely, in the counterfactual scenario, these features are replaced with 'perform', 'control', 'cach', 'transact', 'physic', 'sensit', 'ratio', 'zero', 'disjunct', 'gateway', 'ru', 'rollback', 'mutat', 'atmospher', and 'axiom'. These new features suggest a shift towards methodologies more characteristic of 'Probabilistic_Methods'. Despite this change in features, the classification does not differ between the factual and counterfactual cases; however, the underlying reasons for maintaining the same classification may involve factors beyond just the immediate neighboring nodes. For instance, the overall graph structure, global distribution of classes among all nodes, and possibly other unseen contextual information within the dataset could influence why the classification remains consistent despite local feature variations at the target node.Original target nodes features: ['model', 'object', 'autom', 'strategi', 'appear', 'nest', 'precondit', 'gateway']",
    "214": "In the original graph, Node 5 was classified under the category 'Reinforcement_Learning,' indicating that it likely represents papers focusing on reinforcement learning techniques within the context of citation networks. However, when we examine the counterfactual scenario where Node 5's features include 'polar' instead of 'haskell,' the classification shifts to 'Rule_Learning.' This suggests that the inclusion of 'polar' terms may align more closely with themes associated with rule-based learning methods rather than those typically found in reinforcement learning literature. Considering the influence of neighboring nodes, since they remain consistent across both scenarios, the shift in classification appears to be primarily driven by the change in the node's own feature set. In particular, the replacement of 'haskell'\u2014a term often associated with functional programming languages and potentially computational approaches relevant to reinforcement learning\u2014with 'polar,' possibly indicative of polarization or contrastive analysis, steers the interpretation towards rule-learning paradigms. Thus, the modification of just two features ('haskell' to 'polar') significantly alters the perceived focus area of the node within the broader scope of academic research topics.Original target nodes features: ['network', 'real', 'situat', 'avoid', 'em', 'replac', 'pack', 'resili', 'push', 'haskell']",

However, when we examine the counterfactual scenario where Node 5 retains the same neighbors but exhibits features more aligned with Rule_Learning, such as 'polygon', 'common', 'mach', 'simplifi', etc., the classification shifts towards Rule_Learning. This suggests that the context provided by neighboring nodes plays a significant role in determining the classification. In this case, despite the core features remaining similar, the introduction of terms typically linked with rule-based systems ('specifi', 'choic', 'modal', 'next', 'length', 'shift', 'start', 'adversari') influenced the interpretation of Node 5's function within the graph. These changes imply that even subtle variations in node features, especially those shared among neighbors, can significantly impact the overall understanding of the node's role and classification within the domain of graph-based learning.Original target nodes features: ['verif', 'increment', 'updat', 'e', 'align', 'sensit', 'pack', 'predictor', 'dissemin', 'dictionari', 'confid', 'ubiquit']",
    "223": "In both the factual and counterfactual examples, the target node '1' remains classified under 'Case_Based'. However, there are minor changes in the node features when comparing the factual scenario to the counterfactual one. Specifically, the attribute 'understand' was replaced with 'rel', and 'fundament' was substituted with 'b'. These changes suggest that while the overall classification does not shift, the nature of the information associated with the node may influence the context within which it is understood. In terms of neighboring nodes, since they remain consistent across both scenarios ('2' and '3'), we cannot directly infer any impact on the classification based solely on these connections. Nevertheless, the interplay between node features and their neighbors could potentially affect the propagation of information through the graph, thereby indirectly influencing the classification results. For instance, if '2' and '3' possess strong associations with other nodes representing similar themes or methodologies, the consistency in their connection patterns reinforces the relevance of the 'Case_Based' category for node '1'. Consequently, even though the direct features did not change significantly, the structural integrity of the graph and the semantic proximity among connected nodes contribute to preserving the same classification label.Original target nodes features: ['understand', 'convers', 'fundament', 'rel', 'confid', 'cube']",
    "231": "In the original graph, Node 12 was classified under Rule_Learning based on its features and connections within the graph. However, when we examine the counterfactual scenario where some of the node features were changed while keeping the same neighboring nodes, Node 12 still maintains its classification as Rule_Learning. Specifically, the changes in features include replacing 'exampl' with 'multipl', 'feedback' with 'report', 'qualit' with 'toler', 'forward' with 'draft', 'mach' with 'resili', 'stereoscop' with 'claus', and 'bibliographi' with 'recept'. Despite these alterations, the overall pattern of features associated with Rule_Learning remains consistent, suggesting that the influence of neighboring nodes and the collective feature set contribute significantly to preserving the classification of Node 12. In essence, the local changes in individual node features do not drastically shift the context provided by the surrounding nodes, thereby supporting the notion that the classification of Node 12 as belonging to Rule_Learning is robust against minor variations in its attribute profile.Original target nodes features: ['exampl', 'feedback', 'qualit', 'forward', 'mach', 'templat', 'stereoscop', 'bibliographi', 'resili', 'gigabit', 'illustr', 'environment']",

This suggests that the inclusion of these particular features ('fair', 'speed', etc.) associated with theoretical aspects rather than rule-based methodologies leads to a different interpretation of the node's role within the context of the graph. The influence of neighboring nodes remains consistent across both scenarios, highlighting that while the local feature adjustments at Node 0 are critical for changing its classification, the overall structural connectivity provided by its neighbors does not significantly impact this transition.Original target nodes features: ['network', 'databas', 'adapt', 'order', 'hybrid', 'size', 'spoken', 'monoton', 'realist', 'ip', 'conserv', 'gateway', 'sql', 'chart', 'confid']",

This suggests that the removal or modification of certain keywords related to practical implementations and components leads to a reclassification emphasizing more on the underlying principles and theories. Furthermore, considering the influence of neighboring nodes, since both the factual and counterfactual examples maintain connections solely with Node 0, there isn't any direct impact observed from other nodes on the classification shift. Instead, the transformation seems intrinsic to the selected features themselves, highlighting the importance of these particular attributes in determining the theoretical orientation of the subject matter.Original target nodes features: ['control, robust, track, storag, compon, valu, stabil, resolut, feedback, common, fair, call, result, nest, deadlin, pack, constant, perceptron, gateway, assumpt, newton, np, lexicon, confid, imper, priorit']",

This suggests that the inclusion of these particular features significantly influenced the model's prediction towards a different category. Although Node 0 remains connected to Node 2, indicating no structural changes within the graph, the modification in feature values appears to be sufficient to alter the classification. In essence, the transition from 'Neural_Networks' to 'Probabilistic_Methods' highlights the sensitivity of the model to specific feature combinations and underscores the importance of understanding feature relevance in graph-based learning tasks.Original target nodes features: ['control', 'domain', 'processor', 'properti', 'layer', 'observ', 'content', 'good', 'nest', 'quantit', 'safeti', 'obstacl', 'teach', 'nearest', 'neuron', 'life', 'dual', 'predictor', 'need', 'gateway', 'overlap', 'apprentic', 'fourier']",

These features suggest a focus on optimization techniques and evolutionary strategies, hallmarks of genetic algorithm research. Consequently, changing just a few key features from 'Case_Based' to ones indicative of 'Genetic_Algorithms' leads to a reclassification of Node 7. While the neighboring nodes remain consistent across both scenarios, indicating that the immediate context within the graph does not directly influence the shift in classification, it underscores the importance of individual node features in determining the overall classification in graph-based learning tasks.Original target nodes features: ['processor', 'intern', 'deduct', 'presenc', 'medic', 'equal', 'nearest', 'resolv', 'short', 'rfc', 'apprentic']"
