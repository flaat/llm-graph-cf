    "248": "The change in classification from \"Rule_Learning\" to \"Theory\" for the target node 4 can be attributed to the removal of several words related to rule learning and multi-strategy approaches from its feature vector. These words include \"multipl\", \"messag\", \"datalog\", \"multistrategi\", and \"np\". By removing these words, the model classifies the node as \"Theory\" instead.Original target nodes features: ['multipl', 'messag', 'version', 'conflict', 'result', 'increas', 'orthogon', 'datalog', 'pack', 'multistrategi', 'need', 'np', 'confid', 'overlap']",
    "253": "The change in classification for the target node (node 2) from Rule_Learning to Theory in the counterfactual graph is primarily due to the removal of attributes related to management, iteration, realism, and annotation. These attributes were present in the factual graph but absent in the counterfactual graph.Original target nodes features: ['manag', 'iter', 'realist', 'best', 'annot']",
    "258": "The change in classification for Node 7 from Probabilistic_Methods to Reinforcement_Learning can be attributed to the alteration of its features, specifically the removal of probabilistic-related terms and the addition of reinforcement learning-related terms.Original target nodes features: ['control', 'embed', 'bandwidth', 'singl', 'scene', 'speed', 'throughput', 'nest', 'serial', 'mach', 'safeti', 'best', 'fulli', 'divers', 'need', 'b', 'addit', 'crash', 'atmospher', 'polari']",
    "259": "The main difference between the factual and counterfactual examples for Node 2 lies in the presence or absence of certain words in the node features. In the factual example, the node features include \"simpl\", \"audio\", \"revers\", \"movement\", and \"chapter\", which are absent in the counterfactual example. These changes in features led to a shift in the classification of Node 2 from Genetic_Algorithms to Neural_Networks.Original target nodes features: ['use', 'interact', 'simpl', 'java', 'audio', 'revers', 'quantifi', 'pack', 'gateway', 'b', 'assumpt', 'ru', 'confid', 'oracl', 'movement', 'chapter']",
    "261": "In the original graph, Node 1 was classified as Reinforcement_Learning due to its features like 'bayesian', 'reduct', and 'coher'. However, when these features were removed, the node was classified as Rule_Learning in the counterfactual example. The removal of these features may have influenced the model to focus more on the remaining features like 'code', 'common', and 'consider', which are more associated with Rule_Learning.Original target nodes features: ['code', 'bayesian', 'reduct', 'coher', 'probabl', 'common', 'color', 'spoken', 'futur', 'medic', 'consider', 'discrimin', 'behaviour', 'mach', 'expans', 'perturb', 'camera', 'actor', 'chapter', 'across', 'byzantin']"
