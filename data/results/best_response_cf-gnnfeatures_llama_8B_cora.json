    "46": "The target node 17 was classified as Reinforcement_Learning in the factual graph but as Rule_Learning in the counterfactual graph. This change in classification can be attributed to the removal of features such as \"relat\", \"decomposit\", \"theorem\", \"workstat\", \"versu\", \"interpol\", \"futur\", \"fuzzi\", \"behaviour\", \"recent\", \"fusion\", and \"trust\" from the target node. These features were present in the factual graph but absent in the counterfactual graph. The presence of these features likely contributed to the target node being classified as Reinforcement_Learning in the factual graph. In contrast, the counterfactual graph, which lacks these features, resulted in the target node being classified as Rule_Learning.Original target nodes features: ['relat', 'decomposit', 'theorem', 'workstat', 'modul', 'render', 'versu', 'interpol', 'futur', 'fuzzi', 'behaviour', 'recent', 'strong', 'fusion', 'blind', 'trust', 'predictor', 'gateway', 'probe', 'resili']",

However, in the counterfactual graph, the node 17 was classified as Probabilistic_Methods because the features \"calculu\", \"consider\", \"multilevel\", \"shift\", and \"customiz\" were removed, indicating a shift towards probabilistic models and methods.Original target nodes features: ['action', 'find', 'workstat', 'calculu', 'verifi', 'open', 'common', 'illumin', 'consider', 'multilevel', 'next', 'shift', 'customiz', 'place', 'treatment', 'resili', 'credit']",

The changes in features indicate a shift from probabilistic methods to reinforcement learning techniques, likely due to the addition of new words related to agent-based systems and dynamic environments.Original target nodes features: ['control', 'improv', 'processor', 'resolut', 'migrat', 'admiss', 'rapid', 'nest', 'precondit', 'pack', 'aircraft', 'complement', 'bind', 'side', 'uncertain', 'unpublish', 'environment', 'tutor']",

This change in classification can be attributed to the removal of features related to reinforcement learning, such as \"implement\", \"expert\", and \"plane\", and the addition of features related to rule learning, such as \"tcp\" and \"n\". The influence of the neighboring nodes, such as 3, 4, and 6, may also have played a role in this change, as they share similar features with the target node.Original target nodes features: ['control', 'support', 'global', 'c', 'note', 'authent', 'versu', 'interpol', 'spoken', 'invers', 'good', 'exist', 'sensit', 'strong', 'gateway', 'permut', 'classic', 'intuitionist', 'magnet', 'resili']",
