    "5": "The classification of node 3 shifted from Theory to Case-Based. This change was achieved by modifying the features of node 3 from the original set of words to include more terms related to fast algorithms, path analysis, and result generation. These changes influenced the node's classification towards a method that deals with case-based reasoning and problem-solving.",
    "6": "The counterfactual explanation for node 0 indicates that if the node's features were changed to include words like 'messag', 'path', 'irregular', 'solver', 'specifi', 'good', 'next', 'length', 'english', 'microkernel', 'shift', 'see', 'fusion', 'cross', 'start', 'adversari', 'apprentic', 'bind', 'rollback', 'pivot', 'disciplin', and 'gap', the node's classification would change from 'Theory' to 'Case_Based'. These changes suggest that the addition of these specific features, which relate to aspects of problem-solving and technical details, led to a shift in the node's classification.",
    "9": "In the counterfactual scenario, the attributes of node 9 were changed to match those of node 0. This resulted in the node being classified as Probabilistic_Methods, which is a significant shift from its original classification as Case_Based.",
    "11": "The counterfactual explanation for the target node 15 indicates that the classification changed from Probabilistic Methods to Reinforcement Learning. Despite the fact that the node's features did not change (all features remained the same), the influence of its neighbors played a significant role in this shift.",
    "19": "The node 8 is classified as Reinforcement_Learning. Its features include words like logic, recognit, access, array, reduct, topolog, solver, signatur, good, squar, walk, terminolog, gateway, petri, np, lexicon, confid, infinit, electr, uncertain, sprite. Despite the same set of features and connections, the classification remains the same.",
    "20": "For the target node 3, which was originally classified as Reinforcement_Learning, the counterfactual example shows that changing the node's features to those of a node classified as Rule_Learning resulted in the node being reclassified as Rule_Learning.",
    "22": "The counterfactual explanation for the target node 1 indicates that changing the features associated with the node from those of a Probabilistic_Methods node to those of a Reinforcement_Learning node led to a change in classification from Probabilistic_Methods to Reinforcement_Learning.",
    "27": "The counterfactual example shows that the classification of node 15 remains Case_Based when its features are unchanged. This suggests that the features of node 15 do not significantly influence its classification as Case_Based.",
    "30": "Despite changes in the features and connections of node 24, its classification as Reinforcement_Learning remains unchanged.",
    "35": "The classification of the target node from 'Neural_Networks' to 'Probabilistic_Methods' was achieved without any changes to the node's features or its connections to other nodes. Despite the fact that the node's features remained unchanged, the model's prediction changed due to the influence of its neighbors' features.",
    "37": "The target node was originally classified as Reinforcement Learning but was reclassified as Probabilistic Methods after changing its features.",
    "46": "In the counterfactual scenario, the target node's attributes have shifted towards more related to 'represent', 'video', 'secur', 'equat', 'static', 'word', 'queue', 'lightweight', 'expert', 'lock', 'microkernel', 'sensit', 'expect', 'intens', 'abduct', 'decoupl', 'newton', 'reachabl', 'deleg', 'environment', and 'lesson'. These changes suggest that the target node's focus has moved towards more related to 'representation' and 'security', which were previously absent in its original attributes.",
    "47": "The only difference between the factual and counterfactual target node is the set of features. Despite these minor changes, the classification remains the same.",
    "59": "",
    "64": "For the node representing the paper with ID 14, which was originally classified as Rule_Learning, the counterfactual explanation suggests that changing the features of the node from its original state to the same state as node 5 (which is classified as Theory) led to a different prediction. Specifically, the features of node 14 did not change, but the influence of its neighbors remained the same. This implies that the classification shift from Rule_Learning to Theory is solely due to the influence of its neighbors, rather than any modification of its own features.",
    "65": "For the node 0, which was originally classified as Theory but should have been classified as Case_Based, the key changes were the removal of the words 'environ', 'web', 'knowledg', 'satisfact', 'draft', 'residu', 'conserv', 'shadow', 'gateway', 'diffus', 'imper', and 'haskel'. These words were replaced with 'oper', 'note', 'solver', 'rollback', and 'chapter', which are more indicative of Case_Based research.",
    "67": "In the counterfactual scenario, the target node's features remained unchanged compared to the factual scenario. However, the classification did not change from Reinforcement_Learning to any other class.",
    "70": "The classification of node 3 changed from Rule_Learning to Probabilistic_Methods in the counterfactual scenario. This shift was primarily influenced by the addition of new features such as 'code', 'decis', 'secur', 'java', 'balanc', 'review', 'fuzzi', 'wormhol', 'expect', 'scan', 'substitut', 'abduct', 'air', 'gateway', 'archiv', 'wire', 'proxim', 'probe', 'resili', 'vortex', 'unreli', 'haskel'. These new features suggest a transition towards probabilistic modeling, which is consistent with the change in classification."
