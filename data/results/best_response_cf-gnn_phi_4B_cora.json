    "35": "In the original graph, Node 3 was classified under 'Neural_Networks' based on its features and connections within the graph. However, when we examine the counterfactual scenario where Node 3 shares additional features like 'type', 'synthesi', and 'layer' with Nodes 1 and 2, which are associated with 'Probabilistic_Methods', there is a shift in classification towards 'Probabilistic_Methods'. This suggests that the inclusion of these new features influenced the prediction made by the graph neural network model. Specifically, the term 'layer' implies a structured approach often seen in probabilistic models, while 'synthesi' may indicate a blend of methodologies, potentially leaning more towards probabilistic techniques rather than purely neural network approaches. Therefore, the neighboring nodes and their shared characteristics play a crucial role in determining the classification of Node 3, leading to a reclassification from 'Neural_Networks' to 'Probabilistic_Methods' in the counterfactual analysis.Original target nodes features: ['test', 'scale', 'recoveri', 'wireless', 'context', 'open', 'common', 'thread', 'rapid', 'multiag', 'step', 'lock', 'multistrategi', 'ant', 'petri', 'lexicon', 'imper', 'intent', 'kinemat', 'rollback', 'learner', 'mass']",
    "36": "In the original scenario, Node 2 was classified under the 'Case_Based' category, indicating that its content primarily dealt with case-based learning approaches. However, when we examine the counterfactual situation where Node 2 retains connections only with Node 3 but alters its own set of features, there is a shift towards characteristics associated with theoretical studies ('Theory'). Specifically, the introduction of terms like 'schedul,' 'simul,' 'experi,' 'tool,' 'partial,' 'lower,' 'wavelet,' 'admiss,' 'lattic,' 'result,' 'multidestin,' 'disjunct,' 'gateway,' 'critiqu,' 'np,' reflects a focus on more abstract, methodological aspects rather than practical applications typical of 'Case_Based' research. These changes suggest that even without direct modification of neighboring nodes, the subtle adjustment in Node 2's feature profile leads to a reclassification to align with theoretical explorations within the domain of machine learning. This demonstrates the sensitivity of graph-based models to local structural and attribute variations, highlighting the importance of understanding both global topology and fine-grained feature distributions for accurate prediction interpretation.Original target nodes features: ['perform', 'simul', 'measur', 'descript', 'workstat', 'hierarchi', 'overview', 'associ', 'context', 'heurist', 'pointer', 'massiv', 'relationship', 'fpga', 'exist', 'stripe', 'intrus', 'convert', 'speaker', 'modern', 'skill']",
    "39": "In both the factual and counterfactual examples provided, the features associated with the target node (node ID 9) remain identical. Node 9 is characterized by features such as 'control', 'interact', 'server', 'decomposit', 'branch', 'result', 'nest', 'discrimin', 'rel', 'emul', 'scan', 'dissemin', 'gateway', 'singular', 'confid', 'pivot', 'side', 'chapter', and 'recept'. These features suggest that the node represents information relevant to Probabilistic Methods within the context of the Cora dataset. Since there are no changes in the features between the factual and counterfactual instances, the classification of the target node remains consistent at 'Probabilistic_Methods'. Therefore, the influence of neighboring nodes does not play a role in changing the classification of the target node in these particular cases.Original target nodes features: ['control', 'interact', 'server', 'decomposit', 'branch', 'result', 'nest', 'discrimin', 'rel', 'emul', 'scan', 'dissemin', 'gateway', 'singular', 'confid', 'pivot', 'side', 'chapter', 'recept']",
    "58": "In the original scenario, Node 11 was classified under Probabilistic_Methods based on its features, which included terms like 'environ,' 'comparison,' 'autom,' etc., indicating a focus on probabilistic approaches within the context of environmental comparisons and automated processes. However, when considering a counterfactual situation where Node 11 shares connections primarily with Nodes 0 and 2, whose features emphasize aspects like 'improvement,' 'representation,' 'user experience,' and so forth, the classification shifts towards Case_Based. This shift suggests that the influence of neighboring nodes plays a significant role in determining the classification. Specifically, the connection with Node 0 introduces elements associated with visualization ('heap') and historical analysis ('archiv'), while the linkage with Node 2 brings in themes of improvement ('improv') and human factors ('user'). These adjacent nodes contribute to a narrative more aligned with case-based methodologies, focusing on iterative improvements and practical implementations rather than purely theoretical probabilistic models. Thus, the modification in the set of neighboring nodes leads to a reevaluation of Node 11's classification, highlighting the importance of local structural information in understanding the broader context of graph-based learning tasks.Original target nodes features: ['environ, improv, comparison, autom, increment, preliminari, embed, size, queue, common, cut, medic, fpga, throughput, neighbor, hpf, pack, achiev, year, confid, resili, polari, environment']",
    "59": "In the original scenario, Node 12 was classified under Reinforcement_Learning based on its features and connections within the graph. However, when we examine the counterfactual situation where Node 12 only maintains its connection to Node 0 but loses its link to Node 13, the classification shifts to Probabilistic_Methods. This change occurs because the removal of the connection to Node 13, which represents Reinforcement_Learning, alters the context provided by the neighboring nodes. Specifically, the loss of association with Node 13 diminishes the reinforcement learning aspects present in Node 12's profile. Instead, the remaining features like 'model' and 'genet' align more closely with characteristics typical of Probabilistic_Methods, such as the use of probabilistic models and genetic algorithms. Thus, the modification in the graph's structure\u2014specifically, the change in connectivity among nodes\u2014leads to a revised interpretation of Node 12's role and classification within the dataset.Original target nodes features: ['model', 'evalu', 'genet', 'modul', 'shape', 'trace', 'fuzzi', 'ai', 'debug', 'session', 'best', 'superscalar', 'lambda', 'np', 'preunif', 'classic', 'disciplin']",
    "65": "In the original graph, Node 1, representing a scientific publication, was classified under the category 'Theory,' indicating it dealt with theoretical aspects of machine learning. Its connections included Node 0, suggesting some thematic overlap or citations relevant to theoretical work. However, when we examine the counterfactual scenario, despite retaining most of the same features ('oper', 'note', 'solver', 'rollback', 'chapter'), the addition of the term 'haskell'\u2014a functional programming language often associated with practical implementations rather than pure theory\u2014signals a shift towards more concrete applications. Consequently, the classification changed to 'Case_Based,' implying that the context surrounding Node 1 now aligns more closely with case-based learning approaches. This reclassification suggests that even minor additions to the node's feature set can significantly influence the perceived focus of the research. Moreover, the introduction of new neighbors in the counterfactual scenario may imply broader interdisciplinary connections or references that further support the transition away from purely theoretical contributions.Original target nodes features: ['oper', 'note', 'solver', 'rollback', 'chapter']",
    "70": "In the original graph, Node 3 was classified under Rule_Learning based on its features and connections within the graph. However, when considering a counterfactual scenario where only the neighboring nodes are changed, we observe that Node 3 now shares more common features with Node 6, which is also classified under Rule_Learning. Specifically, the addition of features like 'code', 'decis', 'secur', 'java', 'balanc', 'review', 'fuzzi', 'wormhol', 'expect', 'scan', 'pack', 'fractal', 'archiv', 'bootstrap', 'treatment', 'electr', 'passiv', 'credit' aligns more closely with the characteristics associated with Rule_Learning. These shared features suggest that the influence of Node 6, being a neighbor with similar attribute patterns, may contribute to reinforcing the Rule_Learning classification for Node 3 in the counterfactual scenario.Original target nodes features: ['mobil', 'autom', 'sequenti', 'segment', 'real', 'window', 'critic', 'normal', 'lock', 'potenti', 'hash', 'introspect', 'hpf', 'constant', 'abduct', 'achiev', 'tcl', 'reachabl', 'electr', 'deleg']"
