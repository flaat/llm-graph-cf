    "7": "The target node (node 10) was originally classified as Reinforcement_Learning. In the counterfactual scenario, the node lost connections to nodes 7 and 15, both classified as Reinforcement_Learning, and retained connections to nodes 1, 3, and 11, which are classified as Rule_Learning. This change in neighborhood influenced the node to be reclassified as Rule_Learning.",
    "8": "The target node (Node 25) was originally classified as \"Theory\" in the factual scenario. In the counterfactual scenario, it is reclassified as \"Case_Based\". The change in classification is primarily due to the reduction in the number of neighboring nodes from six to two. Specifically, nodes 13, 16, and 22 were removed from the neighborhood, which likely altered the influence of these nodes on Node 25. These removed nodes were classified as \"Rule_Learning\", \"Probabilistic_Methods\", and \"Theory\", respectively, which may have contributed to the original classification of Node 25 as \"Theory\".",
    "9": "In the factual scenario, Node 9 is classified as Theory and is connected to Nodes 0 and 4. In the counterfactual scenario, Node 9 is reclassified as Case_Based despite retaining the same attributes. The change in classification is influenced by the broader context of the graph, particularly the shift in Node 3 from Rule_Learning to Neural_Networks, which alters the overall structure and potentially impacts the model\u2019s decision-making process.",
    "11": "Node 15 was originally classified as Probabilistic_Methods in the factual graph. In the counterfactual scenario, it is reclassified as Reinforcement_Learning. The primary change lies in the connections of its neighboring nodes. Specifically, node 17, which was previously connected to node 15, is no longer connected, and node 3, which was previously connected to both node 15 and node 17, now only connects to node 15. This alteration in the graph structure influenced the classification of node 15.",
    "15": "The target node (node 22) was originally classified as Probabilistic_Methods. By removing the connection to node 8 (also classified as Probabilistic_Methods), the influence of nodes classified as Probabilistic_Methods decreases. Meanwhile, retaining the connection to node 11 (classified as Reinforcement_Learning) reinforces the influence of nodes classified as Reinforcement_Learning. Consequently, the target node shifts its classification from Probabilistic_Methods to Reinforcement_Learning.",

In the counterfactual scenario, Node 8 retained the same attributes but lost connections to nodes classified as Probabilistic_Methods and Case_Based, gaining connections only to nodes classified as Reinforcement_Learning. This shift in neighborhood led to Node 8 being reclassified as Reinforcement_Learning.",
    "20": "In the factual scenario, Node 3 is classified as Reinforcement_Learning due to its connections with other Reinforcement_Learning nodes.

    "27": "In the factual graph, Node 15 is classified as 'Theory' and is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 24. In the counterfactual graph, Node 15 is reclassified as 'Case_Based' after removing connections to nodes 8 and 24, leaving only a connection to node 7, which is classified as 'Case_Based'. The removal of these connections significantly alters the influence of neighboring nodes, leading to a change in the classification.",
    "29": "In the factual scenario, Node 14 is classified as Probabilistic_Methods due to its connections with other nodes classified similarly. In the counterfactual scenario, Node 14 is reclassified as Reinforcement_Learning because it is only connected to Node 9, which is classified as Reinforcement_Learning. This shift highlights the sensitivity of the classification to the graph structure and the influence of neighboring nodes.",
    "30": "Node 24 was originally classified as Probabilistic_Methods based on its attributes and the influence of its neighbors. In the counterfactual scenario, despite having the same attributes and connections, node 24 is reclassified as Reinforcement_Learning. This shift likely results from the increased influence of node 27, which is classified as Reinforcement_Learning, suggesting that the model's decision boundary has shifted due to the context provided by neighboring nodes.",
    "31": "Node 34 was originally classified as Probabilistic_Methods in the factual graph. In the counterfactual graph, it is reclassified as Reinforcement_Learning. This change is driven by the removal of connections to nodes 9 and 26, which were classified as Probabilistic_Methods. The loss of these connections reduces the influence of Probabilistic_Methods nodes, leading to a shift towards Reinforcement_Learning.",

However, in the counterfactual scenario, the classification of node 36 changes to Reinforcement_Learning. This change is primarily driven by the influence of its neighboring nodes, particularly node 32, which is classified as Reinforcement_Learning. Despite maintaining the same attributes and connections, the overall context provided by the neighboring nodes shifts towards Reinforcement_Learning, leading to a different classification for node 36.",
    "39": "The target node (Node 9) was initially classified as 'Neural_Networks' due to its connections with both 'Probabilistic_Methods' and 'Neural_Networks' nodes. In the counterfactual scenario, the connections to 'Neural_Networks' nodes were removed, leaving only connections to 'Probabilistic_Methods' nodes. This shift in neighborhood structure altered the influence on Node 9, resulting in its reclassification as 'Probabilistic_Methods'.",
    "40": "The target node (Node 17) was originally classified as \"Probabilistic Methods\" in the factual graph. In the counterfactual graph, its classification changed to \"Reinforcement Learning\".

In the counterfactual scenario, node 7 remains classified as Reinforcement_Learning but loses connections to nodes 3 and 19, which are both classified as Probabilistic_Methods. This change in neighborhood alters the influence of neighboring nodes, leading to a shift in the classification of node 7.",

    "51": "In the factual graph, node 5 is classified as Probabilistic_Methods and is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6. In the counterfactual graph, node 5 is still classified as Probabilistic_Methods but is connected only to nodes 2 and 3, with node 6 removed as a neighbor. Additionally, node 2 is reclassified from Probabilistic_Methods to Reinforcement_Learning. As a result, node 5 is reclassified as Reinforcement_Learning in the counterfactual scenario.",
    "54": "In the factual scenario, node 9 is classified as Theory and is connected to nodes 26, 33, and 35. In the counterfactual scenario, node 9 remains classified as Case_Based after removing connections to nodes 26 and 33, retaining only the connection to node 35. The change in classification is primarily influenced by the removal of connections to nodes 26 and 33.",

    "56": "In the factual graph, the target node (node 18) is classified as \"Theory\" due to its connections with nodes 9 and 22, which are also classified as \"Theory.\" In the counterfactual scenario, the removal of nodes 9 and 22 alters the neighborhood structure, reducing the influence of \"Theory\"-classified nodes. Consequently, the target node is reclassified as \"Case_Based\" because the remaining neighbors (nodes 8, 10, and 19) are predominantly classified as \"Case_Based,\" thus shifting the overall influence towards this class.",
    "57": "Node 8 was originally classified as Probabilistic_Methods in the factual graph. In the counterfactual scenario, its classification changes to Reinforcement_Learning. This change is primarily driven by alterations in its neighborhood structure rather than any change in its own features. Specifically, Node 8 loses connections to many of its original neighbors and gains new connections to Nodes 1, 7, 19, and 21, all of which are classified as Reinforcement_Learning. These changes in connectivity likely influenced the model to reclassify Node 8 based on the new neighborhood context.",
    "58": "The target node (Node 11) was originally classified as \"Neural_Networks\" in the factual graph. However, in the counterfactual graph, it is reclassified as \"Probabilistic_Methods\". Despite having identical attributes and connections to the same neighboring nodes (0 and 1), the classification changes due to alterations in the graph structure or node features of other nodes. Specifically, the classification shift can be attributed to changes in the classification of neighboring nodes, such as Node 5 being reclassified from \"Rule_Learning\" to \"Neural_Networks\" and Node 4 being reclassified from \"Probabilistic_Methods\" to \"Case_Based\". These changes influence the overall context and connectivity patterns within the graph, leading to a different prediction for Node 11.",

In the counterfactual graph, node 12 is classified as Reinforcement_Learning and is only connected to node 13. The change in classification is primarily influenced by the removal of the connection to node 0, which was also classified as Probabilistic_Methods. This suggests that the connection to node 0, which shares similar characteristics, significantly impacts the classification of node 12.",

    "64": "In the factual scenario, Node 14 is classified as Rule_Learning. However, in the counterfactual scenario, Node 14 is reclassified as Theory. The change in classification is influenced by the overall context provided by its neighbors. Specifically, Node 16, which is a Theory node, seems to have a significant influence on the classification of Node 14. Despite having the same set of attributes in both scenarios, the classification shifts from Rule_Learning to Theory, indicating that the model relies heavily on the neighborhood structure and possibly the global context of the graph.",
