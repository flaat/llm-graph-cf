    "65": "The target node's classification changed from Case_Based to Theory because the counterfactual example provided a new set of features that were not present in the factual example. The node's features were altered from ['oper', 'note', 'solver', 'rollback', 'chapter'] to ['environ', 'knowledg', 'web', 'note', 'diffus']. This change in features led to a different classification, indicating that the node's content and context have shifted from being classified under Case_Based to Theory.Original target nodes features: ['oper', 'note', 'solver', 'rollback', 'chapter']"
